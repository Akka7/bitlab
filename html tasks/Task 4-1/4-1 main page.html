                <p>The Alliance makes a retaliatory strike against her home base, the Undercity, which was formerly the human capital of Lordaeron. After a long, drawn-out battle, which includes Sylvanas revealing a powerful Azerite weapon and High Overlord Varok Saurfang being captured by Alliance champions, the Horde is pushed back to the throne room and is eventually driven out entirely. As a parting gift, however, Sylvanas saturates the area with disease and toxins that render the kingdom uninhabitable. With this tit-for-tat military exchange, the Horde has almost complete control over Kalimdor, while the Alliance has near-total dominion over the Eastern Kingdoms. With further conflict inevitable, Battle for Azeroth takes the two factions to the continents of Kul Tiras and Zandalar where they attempt to recruit new allies in order to turn the tides of war</p>

                <p>Kel'Thuzad (pronounced /'kɛlθʔzɑːd/) was a powerful human mage, an archmage of the Kirin Tor, and member of the Council of Six until his interest in the dark arts caused him to be stripped of his rank and holdings, and exiled from Dalaran by the Grand Magus Antonidas. Driven by the voice in his head, he traveled to Northrend and climbed the Frozen Throne to offer his soul to the Lich King.</p>
